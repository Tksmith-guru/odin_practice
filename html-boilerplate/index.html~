			<p>This is the first time that I'm creating a paragraph in <strong>html</strong> using the p- tags</p>
			<p><h1>We have namely six heading tags in <strong>html</strong>, the biggest is the smallest and vices-versa</p></h1>
			<h1>The first paragraph is the first heading</h1>
			<h2>The second paragraph is the second heading</h2>
			<h3>The third paragraph is the third heading</h3>
			<h4>This is another heading, but smaller in size</h4>
			<h5>This is a much smaller heading than the previous one</h5>
			<h6>This is an even smaller heading</h6>
			
			<p><strong>This marks the begininng of leanring how to use the strong tag to make texts bold</p></strong>
